So the title could be a teeny weeny bit misleading, especially if you're anything like me and spend far too much time following the [Caitlyn Jenner](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=caitlyn+jenner+transition) transition from being Bruce or watching [BBC Three](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree) documentaries. This is not my coming out post. I have nothing to come out of! The transition I'm referring to is my career transition.

This chapter of my life started in 2012. I was working as a Presentation Scheduler on [Alibi](https://alibi.uktv.co.uk/) making sure all the commercial breaks, sponsorship, branding and most importantly the programmes were in the correct order and duration. I LOVE my old colleagues but the job was monotonous and my brain started to rot. At this time I was encouraged to change careers and start using my intelligence.

Ok so what's a girl to do with her life:

- _<s>Chef,</s>_
- _<s>Professional Photographer,</s>_
- _<s>Professional Blogger,</s>_
- _<s>Marketer</s>_

Or I could **make things with computers**
